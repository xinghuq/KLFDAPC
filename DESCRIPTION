Description: This package implements Kernel local Fisher discriminant analysis of principal components(KLFDAPC). 
    KLFDAPC is known for appying the kernel trick considering the non-linear properties of the data, therefore non-linearlized the local Fisher discriminant analysis. It not only preserves between -group variances, but also retains the within-group variances of tha data. In other words, it keeps both the global and local structure of the data.
